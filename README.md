# Food-Demand-Forecasting
: A meal delivery company which operates in multiple cities has various fulfilment centers in these cities for dispatching meal orders to their customers. The company wants to forecast the demand for upcoming weeks so that these centers will plan the stock of raw materials accordingly. My task was to predict the demand for the next 10 weeks.
